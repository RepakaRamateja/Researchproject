starting the game

Another thing I forgot is that they need an option to exit the game at each step.  This could just be an unobtrusive box in a corner.  Sometime in the tutorial (maybe at the end) show them where the box is and explain that they can use it whenever they want and be paid for what they've already done.  There should be a confirm when they click it so they don't accidentally exit.

One other step I forgot is the three "filtering" experiments where we ask them to play very easy games.  This should go after the tutorial and before the game itself.
